# Docker Certified Associate (DCA) exam study guide

Docker has become very popular over the last few years, unfortunately Docker only have official training did not have a certification track.
Luckily for us this has changed last DockerCon EU 2017, during DockerCon you could be along the first people that could take the exam and get Docker certified.


## Things you might need to know;
- This is a unofficial Docker Certified Associate exam preparation guide, and is not related in any way to Docker Inc!
- Don't expect any real exam answers or something like TestKings or anything similar, you need to learn it yourself ;-) maybe with help of this guide.


## About the exam;
The exam (according to the Docker website) consist of 55 multiple choice questions exam that you need to finish in 80 minutes.
Exam cost are about â‚¬175 or for friends in the US it's $195.

On strange thing about taking the exam is that it's remotely proctored, so you don't go to a exam center to take the exam but you could do it from home.
However it's only supported on a Mac or Windows machine, Linux is not supported.<br>
Also make sure you have Google Chrome installed and be able to install the plugin that they use to monitor you remotely and of course you need to have a webcam so they can see you ;-).

However once you completed the exam, you will get/see the results directly!
