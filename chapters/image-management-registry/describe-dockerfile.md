# Describe Dockerfile options (add, copy, volumes, expose, entrypoint, etc)

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile, a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. <br> Dockerfiles adhere to a specific format and use a specific set of instructions. You can learn the basics on the [Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) page or the [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/).

I would recommend to checkout the [Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) page at the Docker website.
