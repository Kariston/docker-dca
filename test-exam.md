# Docker Certified Associate (DCA) test exam

These question are not from the real Docker DCA exam!!
They are purely based on the exam guidelines you can found in the chapters.

## Things you might need to know;
- This is a unofficial Docker Certified Associate exam preparation guide, and is not related in any way to Docker Inc!
- Don't expect any real exam answers or something like TestKings or anything similar, you need to learn it yourself ;-) hopefully with some help of this guide.
